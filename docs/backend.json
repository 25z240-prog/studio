    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to support a hostel menu voting application with a focus on security, scalability, and ease of debugging. It leverages denormalization for authorization independence and structural segregation for simplified security rules. The core entities are `User`, `MenuItem`, and `Vote`.  User data is stored under the `/users/{userId}` path. Menu items, owned by users, are stored under `/menuItems/{menuItemId}`. This collection stores a `submitterId` to tie the `MenuItem` back to the `User`, but the security rule doesn't need to 'get()' the User document because the `submitterId` is present. Votes for each menu item are kept under `/menuItems/{menuItemId}/votes/{voteId}`. This structure enables performant `list` operations and simplifies security rule definitions.  This design enforces Authorization Independence, since the security rules for votes will rely on the `voterId` field within the `Vote` document itself to ensure that only the user who created the vote can modify/delete it. This avoids the need to `get()` the `User` document in the security rules."
